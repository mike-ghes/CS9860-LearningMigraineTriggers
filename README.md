# CS9860-LearningMigraineTriggers
Chronic migraines affect an estimated 1.4% to 2.2% of the population. These frequent migraines can cause significant pain and disruption to one’s life. A dataset composed of one migraine sufferer’s daily journals over the course of 16 months was analyzed for possible environmental causes or triggers to his migraines. Several models are considered and compared for migraine prediction. From these models, the most impactful triggers were extracted. Orthogonal Matching Pursuit was found to be a good model for both prediction and extraction. This model may prove useful in other self-recorded medical application. A novel approach to ordered-class classification is also proposed for possible applications in rating systems.
